## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [ GitHub Copilot]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generating frontpage"
- Example: "creating an alert for expiry"


**Key Prompts Used:**
- "create a front page with the name fresh shelf displayed in an attractive way with a tag line"
- "display an alert for expiry date as if  if (daysLeft <= 7) status = "🟡 Expiring soon";
    if (daysLeft <= 0) status = "🔴 Expired";
"


**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
